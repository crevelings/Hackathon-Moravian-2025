# Hackathon Moravian 2025

Welcome to the Hackathon Moravian 2025 project!  
This year's challenge is all about **helping students find the best study spots on campus**—with real-time availability, quality ratings, and wellness-focused recommendations.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

Students often struggle to find the perfect place to study:  
- Is there a quiet spot available right now?
- How noisy is it?
- Are there wellness resources nearby (like meditation rooms, green spaces, or healthy food options)?

**Our solution:**  
A platform that maps study spaces across campus, shows their current availability, rates their quality (including sound levels), and highlights nearby wellness amenities.

---

## 🎯 Key Features

- **Live Availability:**  
  See which study spots are open or occupied in real time.

- **Quality Ratings:**  
  Each space is rated for:
  - **Sound Level:** Is it quiet, moderate, or noisy?
  - **Comfort:** Seating, lighting, and temperature.
  - **Wi-Fi Strength:** Connectivity for online work.

- **Wellness Proximity:**  
  Find spaces near:
  - Meditation or relaxation rooms
  - Outdoor green areas
  - Cafés with healthy options
  - Fitness centers

- **Personalized Recommendations:**  
  Get suggestions based on your preferences (quiet, group-friendly, near coffee, etc.).

- **Interactive Map:**  
  Visualize all study spots and wellness resources on campus.

## 🏗️ How It Works

1. **Data Collection:**  
   - Sensors or manual input track occupancy and sound levels.
   - Students and staff can rate spaces for comfort and quality.

2. **Backend:**  
   - Aggregates data on availability, sound, and amenities.
   - Provides an API for the frontend.

3. **Frontend:**  
   - Displays real-time info and maps.
   - Lets users search, filter, and rate spaces.
